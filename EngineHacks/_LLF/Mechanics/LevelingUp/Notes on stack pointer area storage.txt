0x00-0x06: Level up results
0x07 Unused
0x08-0x0E: Deviation
0x0F: Total deviation (not an absolute value; positive and negative cancel each other out)

0x10-0x16: 0xFF if stat should be ignored when increasing most negative deviated stat
0x17: Unused
0x18-0x1E: Growths, then stats tied for most negative deviation (0xFF at offset marks the end)
0x1F: Functionally unused

0x20-0x26: Lowest amount stat can increase by
0x27: Unused
0x28-0x29: Sum of growths
0x2A: Sum of growths/100 (Minimum number of "expected" stat increases)
0x2B: Unused

0x2C-0x2F: r13+0x08 (Deviation)
0x30-0x33: r13+0x10 (If stat should be ignored)
0x34-0x37: r13+0x18 (Growths/Stats tied)
0x38-0x3B: r13+0x20 (Lowest amount stats can increase by)

0x3C-0x3F: Offset to battle struct of unit gaining exp/leveling up (Attacker/Defender)
0x40-0x43: Offset of unit in ram

Instead of storing CalcLevelUp in this area, just directly load it
