[OpenMidLeft]
My promise to [TR]Pyrus[TR].[AN]
Is he home?[A]

[OpenFarRight]
I'm afraid not.[AN]
You haven't heard from him?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Not in a long time, no.[A]

[OpenRight]
Oh dear.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Why don't we have a[N]
chat inside?[AN]
My tea's just about done.[A]

## Ch1Intro2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadOldMan]
[OpenLeft][LoadOldWoman]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZoren]
So, what has he been up to?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
When we last heard from him,[N]
he was doing mercenary work.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Huh.[A][N]
Wasn't quite what I[N]
was expecting.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Well, a few years after your[N]
family left town,[AN]
he started exercising and[N]
training for combat.[AN]
He caught someone's eye, and[N]
he's been with him ever since.[AN]
At least, that's what I assuming.[AN]
For a long time, he'd write about[N]
his travels and how he was doing.[AN]
He'd even sent us some of the[N]
money he made.[AN]
But now[TMM]...[TMM]well, ever since last year,[AN]
he just sends the gold with[N]
his signature attached.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
What's the group[N]
he's with called?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
The Ruthless Remnants.[AN]
They used to live around here,[AN]
but they moved to [TR]Argustia[TR][N]
shortly after he joined.[AN]
Have you heard of them?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Hmm[TMM]...[TMM]sounds vaguely familiar,[N]
but I can't say for sure.[AN]
Too many mercenary bands to keep[N]
them all straight, these days.[AN]
Anyways, I'll see what I can dig up[N]
in [TR]Argustia[TR], and go from there.[AN]
Even if they're not in the area,[N]
I'll have to learn something useful.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Would you do that for us?[AN]
That would be marvelous.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It's no trouble at all.[AN]
Well, I'd best be off.[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenFarLeft]
Wait![A]

[OpenMidRight]
Huh?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
We, ah, we need something[N]
else from you.[AN]
A favor, if you will.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
A favor?[AN][ToggleSmile]
Sure, anything[N]
for you two.[AN]
What's up?[A]

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, there's been a lot of talk about[N]
bandits these days.[AN]
People have been whispering about[N]
a [f"]Bandit King[b"].[AN][ToggleSmile]
You remember Gert, don't you, dear?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Of course.[AN]
Apparently he's well known[N]
in [TR]Argustia[TR], too.[A]

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Really?[AN]
I didn't think he'd[N]
be so famous.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
See, Laura, I told you[N]
he's the real deal![AN]
Why, back when[TMM]--[TMM][A]

[OpenLeft]
Dear, another time.[AN]
Let's get back to the bandits.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
See, Zoren, this is why[N]
she's so surprised![AN]
Only I know the stories![AN]
Fine, fine.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Normally, Gert would take care of[N]
trouble like this Bandit King,[AN]
but Gert hasn't been around in[N]
a long while.[AN]
Probably a week or so, wouldn't[N]
you say, Wendell?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Sounds about right.[AN]
There's another young man[N]
looking into them,[AN]
but he hasn't gotten[N]
too far yet.[AN]
Some extra hands would[N]
speed this up.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Very well, I'll take care[N]
of the bandits.[A]

[OpenRight]
I apologize for the interruption,[AN]
but I've something to ask of[N]
you folks, in return.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Why, hello there![AN]
I didn't know you had[N]
a squire, Zoren![A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenLeft]
She's not mine, but she's[N]
with us, regardless.[AN]
What is it, Marcey?[A]

[OpenRight]
While we go after the criminals,[N]
could you two look after Jacob?[AN]
He's a nice lad, he just needs[TMM]--[TMM][A]

[OpenFarRight]
What?[A] No![AN]
I wanna go with[N]
you guys![A]

[OpenRight]
Don't be silly.[AN]
Once we arrive, I must[N]
help with the fighting.[AN]
I can't stay back and[N]
look over you.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't worry, we'll take[N]
good care of him.[AN]
He can even use [TR]Pyrus's[TR][N]
room, for now.[AN]
I'll show you where it is.[A]

[OpenRight]
Thank you.[A][ToggleSmile]

Where can we meet the[N]
man you mentioned?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
He hangs around the[N]
tavern, I think.[AN]
Goes by Davis.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Alright, if that's really all,[N]
I'd better go meet him.[A]

## Ch1Intro3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDavis]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZoren]

Hm, not as big[N]
as I expected.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Well, it's like I said.[AN]
We can take them down together,[N]
as long as we've got a good plan.[AN]
Based on your reputation, I'll leave[N]
that part to you.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Bruce, we've got trouble![AN]
Some intruders just waltzed[N]
right into the entrance![A]

[OpenMidRight]
Well, what are you waiting for!?[AN]
Close the walls up![A]

## Ch1Intro5
[OpenMidRight][LoadBandit2]
Things are gonna get[N]
messy real soon.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Just what Billy and I[N]
were waiting for.[A][ToggleSmile]

## Ch1Intro6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDavis]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZoren]

[OpenMidLeft]
Sounds like they closed off the[N]
pathways through the fort.[AN]
We'll have to get access to[N]
[TR]the tiles[TR] to reopen them.[A]
[X]

## Ch1Intro7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDavis]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZoren]

[OpenMidLeft]
Standing on this tile on the[N]

This tile on the right will reveal[N]
the passage on the left.[A]

## Ch1Intro9

[OpenMidRight][LoadZoren]

[OpenMidLeft]
Finally, this tile further in will open[N]
the second wall on the right.[AN]
I [TR]wrote all of this down[TR],[N]
just as a precaution.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Good thinking.[AN]
Alright, let's get started.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Is the Bandit King among[N]
them, Sir Iris?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Not that I know of, no.[AN]
None of them stood out to me.[AN]
I'll take a look around the perimeter,[N]
in case he fled in the aftermath.[A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight][LoadArlett]
Earlier, I overheard the bandits talking.[AN]
He took a lot of his men with him to[N]
start moving to another location.[AN]
Normally, the area's well guarded,[N]
but it's undermanned right now.[AN]
That place is where I'm supposed to be.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
That doesn't sound good.[AN]
We'd better hurry.[A]

Now then, what do you know?[A]

[OpenRight]
[Beat]The boss-, er, the Bandit King,[N]
wanted to treat everyone.[AN]
S-so he's been sending s-scouts to[N]
a bunch of places nearby.[AN]
There was a village southeast of[N]
here that was tempting,[AN]
if it weren't for all the guards.[AN]
But[Beat][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
But?[A]

[OpenRight]
B-but all of a sudden, there's barely[N]
even a third of the guards around![AN]
So the Bandit King rounded up some[N]
of us to go do some r-raiding.[AN]
T-that's gotta be where he is![A]

[OpenFarRight]
What's the village called?[A]

[OpenRight]
I[Beat]I d-don't know![AN]
He never said what it[N]
was called![AN]
Said it wasn't important![A]

[OpenFarRight]
Are you lying?[A]

[OpenRight]
No![AN]
I p-promise![AN]

[OpenFarRight]
[Beat]I think I know the place[N]
he's talking about, Zoren.[AN]
I'll show you on my map.[AN]
You and everyone else should[N]
start moving.[AN]
I'll catch up with you once[N]
I drop him off.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
