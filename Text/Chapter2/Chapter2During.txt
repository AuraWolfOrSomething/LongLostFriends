[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah, Arlett![AN]
How did your extensive[N]
training session go?[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
What are you talking about?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Isn't that the reason for[N]
your two day absence?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I was kidnapped, you moron![AN]
If it wasn't for the folks I'm helping[N]
now, I'd still be in that cell![A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oh.[A] My mistake.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Well, it's time for[N]
revenge, then?[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM]Yes, exactly.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
In that case, I'd better move[N]

With you at my back, I'll be known[N]

Yes, now I remember.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Yeah.[AN]
Well, now that they've[N]

Just[TMM]--[TMM][A]

[OpenMidRight]
Hey, you're a fellow archer.[AN]
What's your secret to[N]
success, Nordica?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I mean, how are you so[N]
good at using bows?[AN]
I don't think I've gotten[N]
the hang of it yet.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Supposedly, bows are difficult[N]
for most people.[AN]
Have you used projectiles like[N]
them before?[AN]
Like throwing darts?[AN]
Maybe there's a lesson you can[N]
carry over to shooting arrows.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Not really.[AN]
In my hometown, I was the[N]
only archer around.[AN]
People were pretty easy[N]
to impress,[AN]
but there was no one[N]
to learn from.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Someone managed to find a[N]
way to make it even harder.[AN]
Okay, why did you decide to pick[N]
one up in the first place?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Like I said, it was easy to,[N]
uh, impress my neighbors.[AN]
I only started to get[N]
free drinks.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM]And why are you still using them?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM][A]

[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM]Your name's Davis,[N]
right?[AN]
I don't think I can[N]
help you, Davis.[AN]
Good luck.[A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Wait![A] Please![AN]
Even a nibble of advice[N]
could do the trick![A]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadNordica]

[OpenFarLeft]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM][A]

[OpenMidRight]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM][A]

[OpenFarLeft]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM][A]

[OpenMidRight]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM] Okay, let's try a[N]
different angle.[AN]
What about you?[AN]
What made you pick[N]
up a bow?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM]Hunting, mostly.[AN]
The better I got,[AN]
the better my family's[N]
dinner was.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Is that why you're still[N]
practicing your bowmanship?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
No.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
So, uh, what other reason is there?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM][A]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]

[OpenMidLeft]
You want advice?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Yeah.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Imagine your worst enemy.[AN]
Someone you hate so much[TMM]...[.4][TMM][AN]
you never even knew it was possible[N]
to feel this way about anyone.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
If you fail, they won't stop after killing you.[AN]
They'll kill your family and friends next.[AN]
Your home isn't your home anymore; it's a[N]
pathetic pile of rubble once they're done.[AN]
Everyone and everything that you ever[N]
treasured[TMM]...[.4][TMM]is gone.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
See that man over there?[AN]
That's him.[A] Aim, then release.[AN]
If you don't think you can defeat him[N]
now, practice until your next encounter.[AN]
An accurate archer can't survive[N]
without good positioning, either.[AN]
If you let them get close[TMM]...[TMM][AN]
well, we rarely get second chances[N]
in those situations.[AN]
Improve until it never happens again.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM]That's my secret.[AN][CloseEyes]
Excuse me[TMM]...[TMM][A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM]The world definitely has its favorites[TMM]...[TMM][A]

I'm trying to make a bow that[N]
suits weaker archers, but[TMM]...[TMM][AN]
actually, I won't bore you with[N]
the details.[AN]
There's brigands about, after all.[AN]
Just don't try to shoot with this[N]
twice in the same fight, okay?[AN]
It's quite a hassle to set everything[N]
up again for another shot.[A]
