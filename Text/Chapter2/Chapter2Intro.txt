[OpenMidLeft]
Well?[AN]
Any news?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Nothing to report.[AN]
And you?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
So far, nothing out of the ordinary.[AN]
Looking like another calm day.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Heh![A] I'm not surprised.[AN]
Even with Sir Gert gone, the[N]
villagers have nothing to fear.[AN]
As long as I'm here,[AN]
there's not a fiend out there[N]
that's dumb enough to cross me.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I know I'm asking a bit much, Thorbek,[N]
but keep your act together, alright? [AN]
Even if he's supposed to return today,[N]
don't get too overconfident.[AN]
Return to your post and keep a[N]
sharp eye out.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Alright, alright.[AN]
I'll continue to devote my boundless[N]
attention and skill to this task, Mason.[AN][ToggleSmile]
One hundred percent of it, for I am[N]
Thorbek, a champion of justice![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadBandit]

[OpenMidLeft]
Everyone in position?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Yeah, boss.[AN]
The boys are eager[N]
to get started.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I don't blame them.[AN]
We've got a great haul in plain sight,[N]
but it's always been too risky until now.[AN]
Who knows when we'll get another[N]
opportunity like this.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[.4][OpenMidLeft]
Now then, go signal them.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Sure thing, boss![A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft]
Did these foolish knights really[N]
think this would be enough?[AN]
Just a handful of them?[AN]
For me, the Bandit King?[A][ToggleSmile] Ha![AN]
We'll give them a day to remember![A]

## Ch2IntroMason
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMason]
Where did they all come from?![AN]
With this many of them, I doubt I[N]
can safely regroup with Thorbek.[AN]
I hope he's made it back to the[N]
fort, at least.[A]

## Ch2IntroThorbek
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThorbek]
Thorbek the Hearty isn't[N]
one to be trifled with![AN]
Engarde!![A]

## Ch2IntroTalon
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTalon][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha![A] Keep it up, boys![AN]
Get rid of the stragglers,[AN]
and we'll finally have the[N]
whole place to ourselves![A]

## Ch2Intro3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZoren]
Looks like their raid just started.[AN]
We still have time to step in and[N]
stop them, but not much.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM]Jacob?[AN]
What are you[N]
doing here!?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I couldn't stop worrying[N]
about everyone![AN]
Hours and hours of just[N]
sitting around,[AN]
with no news![AN]
I had to make sure[N]
nothing bad happened![A]

[OpenLeft]
Well, we're doing just fine![AN]
Now get somewhere safe, before[N]
the enemy spots us.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
No, I won't.[AN]
All these bandits[TMM]...[.4][TMM]they[N]
remind of home.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I have to fight so I can stop[N]
that from happening again.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Jacob[TMM]...[TMM][A]

[OpenFarLeft]
If that's how you feel, then I[N]
won't force you away.[AN]
But take care of yourself,[N]
alright?[AN]
We might not be able to always[N]
keep an eye on you.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Don't worry, I'll be careful.[A]

[TMM]...[.4][TMM]Jacob? What are you doing here?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I couldn't stop worrying about you all![AN]
Hours and hours of just sitting around,[N]
with no news![AN]
I had to make sure nothing bad happened![A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Well, we're[TMM]...[.4][TMM]holding up.[AN]
I'll explain later, but you'd[N]
better hide somewhere.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
No, I won't.[AN]
All these bandits[TMM]...[.4][TMM]it reminds of home.[AN]
Please let me help, so I can[N]
stop that from happening.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
If that's how you feel, then[N]
I won't force you away.[AN]
But take care of yourself, alright?[AN]
We might not be able to always[N]
keep an eye on you.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Don't worry, I'll be careful.[A]
Besides, Orville and Marcey taught[N]
me some of the basics.[AN]
I'll show you what I've learned![A]
