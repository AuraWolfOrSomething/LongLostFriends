[OpenMidLeft]
Whew, that was a close call.[AN]
If it weren't for you and your[N]
group, I wouldn't have made it.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I'm just glad that we were[N]
able to make it in time.[AN]
We got to finally confront[N]
the "Bandit King", too.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You were tracking him down?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
We took control of his fortress, but once[N]
we realized he wasn't home,[AN]
we rushed over here as fast as we could.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Is that so?[AN]
If you're not sticking around, I'll pass[N]
the good news to my mentor, Sir Gert.[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
No need.[AN]
He has recently found[N]
out for himself.[AN]

Sir Gert![AN]
Welcome back![A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Mason.[A]

[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]
Hey there.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, Zoren.[AN]
It's been many years[N]
since we've talked, no?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Yes, it has.[AN]
Excluding the preparations for[N]
the Battle of Loftenberg,[AN]
it must have been before I[N]
moved away for the war.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
So, what brings you to [TR]Lor Mova[TR]?[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I thought [TR]Pyrus[TR] would return here since the[N]
war's over, but he's apparently not here.[AN]
I'll be continuing my search in [TR]Argustia[TR] now[N]
that these bandits are taken care of.[AN]
So, it's back to Port Atelier for me.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I see.[AN]
I haven't seen him or heard any news,[N]
but I hope your search is fruitful.[AN]
If fate deems it so, our paths will cross[N]
again in [TR]Argustia[TR].[A]

[OpenMidRight]
What makes you say that?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Once my reinforcements arrive,[N]
I will continue my own search.[AN]
Princess Korsana's made an abrupt[N]
disappearance, you see.[AN]
The King refused her request to[N]
have an escort to [TR]Argustia[TR],[AN]
but it seems that didn't dissuade[N]
her from leaving altogether.[AN]
It'd be foolish to even think of[N]
flying there from [TR]Lor Mova[TR],[AN]
so we're trying to discover what[N]
port she's headed for,[AN]
if she's not already gone.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Well, best of luck on[N]
your search, too.[AN]
I'll try to keep my eyes[N]
and ears open.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you.[A]

It looks like they're[N]
clearing out, Zoren.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Good.[AN]
We were too late to[N]
save everyone, but[TMM]...[TMM][A]
we took out the main[N]
threat, I suppose.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
If you don't mind some advice, Zoren,[N]
I'd say to not dwell on it too much.[AN]
This young knight died doing his duty.[AN]
I can certainly say that's better[N]
than[TMM]...[.4][TMM]surviving as a failure.[A]

[OpenLeft]
Sir Iris[TMM]...[TMM][A]

[OpenMidRight]
[TMM]...[.4][TMM]Anyways, I'll go check up on the villagers.[A][ClearFace]

It's good to see you made it[N]

I'm not surprised, though.[A]

I'm glad that you survived[N]
as well, Thorbek.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I was worried about you.[A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]

[OpenFarRight][LoadZoren]
Is this alright, Gert?[A]

[OpenRight]
The capital will be sending many guards[N]
here for my upcoming absence.[AN]
One less shouldn't make a huge difference.[AN]
Besides, you've been a great help here.[AN]
While I can't join you, I can at least offer[N]
some assistance in my stead.[A]
