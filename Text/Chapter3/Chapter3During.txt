[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Ha ha ha![AN]
Do they really think the[N]
wall will collapse?![A]

[OpenMidRight]
Old guard, it's time to crush them[N]
while they're messing around![A]

[OpenLeft]
What in the world...[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Cheer up, Commander.[AN]
At least the men are[N]
enjoying this.[A]

[OpenLeft]
You make a good point.[AN]
Fine, I won't interfere.[AN]
For now.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Commander, can you make them stop[N]
whacking the wall already?[AN]
It was funny at first, but now[N]
it's just wasting our time.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Of course, of course.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow]

[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft][LoadAugustus]
Newcomers, cease this at once![AN]
My men are growing weary of this.[AN]
If you don't stop stalling, they'll[N]
entertain themselves![A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenLeft][LoadShana]
We've almost done it,[N]
everyone![AN]
Just keep at it![A]

Congratulations, newcomers![AN]
Now then, submit your weapons to[N]

Don't get any funny ideas.[A]

Hey, you.[A]

[OpenRight]
[Beat][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What do you know[N]
about our surroundings?[AN]
Is there a good way[N]
out of here?[A]
[X]

## Ch3TransitionPercyAlive2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRivia]
[OpenRight][LoadPercy]
There's a forest south of us.[AN]
We'll encounter some resistance,[N]
but not as much as any other route.[A]

[OpenFarRight][LoadShana]
Then that's our best chance[N]
of escaping this place.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Agreed.[A][X]

## Ch3TransitionPercyDead1

[OpenMidRight][LoadShana]

[OpenMidLeft]
What now, Shana?[AN]
Even out here, there's[N]
still a lot of guards.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Hmm[Beat][AN]
I remember the road they[N]
brought us on.[AN]
Getting out that way[N]
seems unlikely, so[Beat][A]
[X]

## Ch3TransitionPercyDead2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRivia]
[OpenMidRight][LoadShana]
[Beat]Let's head for that forest.[AN]
I don't think they'd post as[N]
many guards there.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Agreed.[A]

Did you see something,[N]
Sir Lorrand?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Yes, Mother Shana.[AN]
This staff has some[N]
wear on it, but[Beat][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
We need anything we can get[N]
our hands on.[AN]
God has graced us with this[N]
gift to ensure our success.[AN]
Now then, if everyone has there[N]
bearings, we should keep moving.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Right behind you,[N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Hey, Sergeant?[A]

[OpenRight]
What?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Weren't, uh, those people over[N]
there, uh, prisoners?[A]

[OpenRight]
[Beat]Huh.[AN]
I believe you're[N]
right about that.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
So, what do we do?[A]

[OpenRight]
Sit back and[N]
watch the show.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Huh?[AN]
Won't the Commander[N]
punish[TMM]--[TMM][A]

[OpenRight][MoveRight]
Hey, listen here, pup.[AN]
Either I can watch the road[N]
for enemy battalions,[AN]
or I can help babysit a bunch[N]
of pathetic prisoners.[AN]
Augustus can't have it[N]
both ways.[AN]
Especially if he keeps cutting[N]
our rations down.[AN]

[OpenFarRight][LoadEnemySoldier]
So it wasn't just my imagination![AN]
Yep, that does it.[AN]
Screw the Commander.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
What if those[N]
people escape?[A]

[OpenRight]
Sounds like Augustus's problem to me.[AN]
But hey, if they wander over here,[N]
feel free to go ahead and kill them.[AN]
Maybe the morons on the other side will[N]
try to stop them, but that's their call.[A]

The two of us is enough[N]
