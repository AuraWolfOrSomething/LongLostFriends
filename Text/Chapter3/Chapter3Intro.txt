Thank you so much, Zoren![AN]
We're sorry we didn't keep a[N]

Don't worry, there's not much[N]
that could've stopped him.[AN]
He's a stubborn lad, I'm afraid.[AN]

It doesn't look like my[N]

Sir Iris, I'll be heading back[N]

I should be able to retrace my steps,[N]
so[Beat]I guess this is farewell.[AN]
What will you do, if I may ask?[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight]
Based on what you just said,[N]
I'm going to Port Atelier.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, you're sticking around?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I don't see why not.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat]Back in [TR]Argustia[TR], it's true that you[N]
said you'd make sure I'd reunite with him.[AN]
However, we also thought he'd be in[N]
[TR]Lor Mova[TR].[AN]
I don't think it's fair to hold you to your word,[N]
when it was made with a faulty assumption.[AN]
Besides, you have your duties to attend[N]
to, right?[AN]
Maybe Prince Orland has recovered[N]
enough to[TMM]--[TMM][A]

[OpenMidRight]
Zoren, he is[Beat]no longer[N]
mine to protect.[AN]
Didn't I tell you that?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
This is my first[N]
time hearing it.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Well, that's the reality[N]
we live in.[AN]
Once I was well enough to[N]
move, I resigned.[AN]
I am[Beat]no longer bound to[N]
duties that I can't fulfill.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Sir Iris[Beat][A]

[OpenMidRight]
So, are there preparations[N]
to be made here in town,[AN]
or are we leaving now?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat]We're leaving.[AN]
If [TR]Pyrus[TR] isn't here, I don't feel any[N]

You must be Zoren.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Grace, sir.[AN]
Sir Gert told me to accompany[N]
you for your help, as of late.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I see.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Another reason to give[N]
him my thanks.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I've found a ship that can take[N]
us to [TR]Argustia[TR].[AN]
With a group of this size, the[N]
captain said it'll work just fine.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Greeting us here was enough already, but[N]
are you sure you want to leave [TR]Lor Mova[TR]?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
There's a friend I want to see.[AN]
Currently, she's stationed in [TR]Argustia[TR].[AN]
It's a very convenient opportunity,[N]
don't you think?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, it's important to keep[N]
up with friends.[AN]
I, of all people, can't argue[N]
against that.[AN]
Welcome aboard, Grace.[AN]
Now then, what's the cost[N]
of the voyage?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Sir Gert has taken care of that.[AN]
Some small compensation and[N]
a letter did the trick.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Is that so?[AN]
Gert's helped me enough,[N]
but this, too?[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
He didn't think you'd[N]
accept it in person,[AN]
so he decided to do it[N]
in this manner.[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft]
How sharp of him.[AN]
No matter, there's no[N]
refusing it now.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Please introduce me to[N]
the captain.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Of course.[AN]
It's possible he's still checking[N]
the ship's inventory,[AN]
so be mindful of where you are.[A]

Yes, Commander Augustus![AN]
Once I noticed one of them was a knight,[AN]
I figured they'd surrender if we took a[N]
few of his friends.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Were they well-armed?[AN]
Trained?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I think they'll make good[N]
combatants, sir.[AN]
They took a few of us out[N]
before they surrendered,[AN]

completely defenseless.[A]

soon enough.[AN]

Well, we'd be foolish to expect rainbows[N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Even so, surely there's still room[N]

Despite our set route, there must[N]

Something more specific than "being[N]
more cautious".[A]
