Ah, the hero of the day.[AN]
Thanks for the help.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
It was no trouble at all.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Do you know what those men[N]
had to gain from this attack?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Beats me.[AN]
Seemed too organized to be simple[N]
pirates, but[Beat][AN]
Well, now that I think about it,[N]
what happened to all the guards?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
What do you mean?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I've been here a few times already,[N]
and every time but today,[AN]
there's at least a handful of[N]
guards wandering around.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat]Those men approached from[N]
the north, no?[AN]
If this is the edge of town,[AN]
then maybe they're occupied with[N]
something further in.[AN]
Guess I'll find out, soon enough.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
You're gonna investigate this?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I'm already an enemy to this[N]
group of mystery men.[AN]
If they're still in the area,[AN]
then I'd prefer to deal with[N]
them now rather later.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
In that case, would you mind allowing a[N]
fellow [TR]Argustian[TR] like me tag along?[AN]
With this contract complete, I'm free[N]
of any obligations.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
What about your men?[AN]
Or your ship?[AN]
Can you abandon all of[N]
them, just like that?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I'm not their captain,[N]
or anything like that.[AN]
I'm just a crew member.[AN]
This situation is too[N]
strange to pass up.[AN]
Besides, I owe you for[N]
saving my life.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Well, if you'd really like to,[N]
I won't stop you.[AN]
A friendly user of elder[N]
magic's hard to come by.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Not [f"]dark magic[b"]?[AN][ToggleSmile]
Heh.[AN]
We'll get along just fine.[A]

[X]

## Ch4EndingRylanDead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZoren]
Good work, everyone![AN]
We'll take a short rest before[N]
heading any further into town..[AN]
I've got a feeling that this isn't[N]
the end of this story.[A]
[X]

## Ch4EndingArtusOtherKill
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMcVicar]
[Beat]Guess Artus wasn't as[N]
tough as he sounded.[AN]
Time for the next contract.[A]
[X]

## Ch4EndingArtusMcVicarKill
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMcVicar]
That takes care of him.[AN]
Time for the next contract.[A]
[X]

## Ch4EndingZorenMcVicar
[OpenRight][LoadMcVicar][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZoren]
Hey![AN]
Who are you, anyways?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMcVicar]
None of your business.[AN]
Don't even think about[N]
following me.[A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight]
A cheery one, indeed.[AN]
Not like it matters, I guess.[AN]
I doubt I'll see him again.[A]
[X]
