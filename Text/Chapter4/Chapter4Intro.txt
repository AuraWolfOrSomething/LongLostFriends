[OpenMidRight][LoadIris]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Sir Iris.[AN]
How are you doing today?[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah, Zoren.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I'm fine, but I think I should be[N]
the one asking that question.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I thought I was finally getting[N]
used to this, but alas.[AN]
I might grow gray hair and still[N]
hate being out here.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Even with yesterday's[Beat]events,[N]
I can see you're making progress.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
I'm happy someone thinks[N]
so, at least.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Trust me.[AN]
In the blink of an eye,[AN]
you'll be looking for your own[N]
ship to sail the seas on.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Now you're just[N]
being ridiculous.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Heh.[AN]
Perhaps I am.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Sir Iris?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
What is it?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Er, never mind.[AN]
Forget it.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[Beat]If you say so.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadZorenShipCaptain]
We've reached land, everyone![AN]
Watch your step, and make sure[N]
you don't leave anything behind.[A]
[ClearFace]

[OpenRight][LoadGrace]
Ah, we're finally here.[AN]
Hard to believe two weeks[N]
have already passed by.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][.4]
[MoveMidLeft]
Hmm[Beat][A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadZoren]
[MoveMidRight]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGrace]
Zoren, there appears to be[N]
some commotion up ahead,[AN]
by that ship in front of us.[AN]
Shall we investigate?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
I suppose so.[AN]
I'd rather take the initiative[N]
than regret it later.[A]

[X]

## Ch4Intro2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArtus]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCalder]
That takes care of[N]
half of them.[AN]
Just a little more work[N]
to clean up the rest.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
We must act fast.[AN]
Even a Queen as incompetent as Lorelei[N]
may have already suspected trouble.[AN]
We need to grab the supplies and leave[N]
long before the army gets here.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Don't worry.[AN]
Leave the rest of[N]
the fighting to me.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Good.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
I have some matters to attend to[N]
at the inn, then I'll depart.[AN]
Send an underling over if you[N]
require further communication.[AN]
Remember, you and the rest of my men[N]
are representing me.[AN]
Don't falter if you want further[N]
work from me.[A]

## Ch4Intro3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRylan]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCaptain]
Aye, Rylan![AN]
What's going on!?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
We're under attack.[AN]
Stay down there until[N]
we clear them out.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
We seem a bit outnumbered,[N]
if you ask me.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Captain, no offense, but this[N]
isn't the time for amateurs.[AN]
Keep yourself alive for the[N]
sake of the crew.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Alright, fine.[AN]
Don't be dying[N]
on me, Rylan.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh.[AN]
You have my word.[A]
[X]

## Ch4Intro4
[OpenRight][LoadZoren]
I don't know who these men are, but[N]
they're up to no good.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]
Everyone, prepare for combat![AN]
We're going to take the town back and[N]
help the sailors as best as we can![A]
