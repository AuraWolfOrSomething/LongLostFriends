## GuideAdvicePrologue
The only anti-turtle to worry[N]
about are brigands targeting[N]
the villages.[N]
The timing required to save[N]
them isn't too strict, but make[N]
sure you visit both of them![X]

## GuideAdviceChapter1
Opening pathways[N]
When reading coordinates,[N]
(0,0) is the top left[N]
corner of the map.[N]
[N]
Tile at (4,13) opens[N]
(13,12) and (14,12)[N]
Tile at (8,10) opens[N]
(1,4) and (2,4)[N]
Tile at (3,1) opens[N]
(12,4) and (13,4)[N]
[N]
To make things easier,[N]
have Franklin move with[N]
the right team, and have[N]
Iris and Davis go with the[N]
left team.[N]
Having Nordica and/or Laric[N]
join the left team is also[N]
a good idea.[X]

## GuideAdviceChapter2
If you decide to go north[N]
past the initial mountain,[N]
don't take too many units[N]
up that path.[N]
4 units should be enough if[N]
Iris is 1 of the 4.[N]
Managing Jacob's position[N]
so that he can have a useful[N]
enemy phase on Turn 5 can[N]
make a big difference.[N]
If that doesn't seem useful,[N]
let him do some shopping,[N]
especially since his Bargain[N]
skill doesn't affect the[N]
preparations shop's prices.[X]

## GuideAdviceChapter3
Part 1[N]
Pick your battles carefully![N]
You do get a healing staff[N]
after finishing Part 1,[N]
but it only has 2 uses.[N]
Additionally, player units[N]
don't heal to full HP[N]
upon starting Part 2.[N]
This also includes Percy,[N]
so try to avoid fighting him.[N]
[N]
Part 2[N]
Ignore the right side of[N]
the map and try to get[N]
at least one of the staves[N]
the Bishops drop.[N]
Remember that Shana can stop[N]
one unit from dying with her[N]
Divine Guidance skill.[X]

## GuideAdviceChapter4
Grace can help deal with the[N]
monks, knights, and Calder.[N]
Try to leave a deployment slot[N]
open for her.[N]
As for the bench, there are[N]
a few notable options.[N]
If Kamron and/or Marcey aren't[N]
leveling well, it's not a bad[N]
chapter for them to sit out,[N]
despite their mounted utility.[N]
If Laric doesn't have a Purge[N]
tome, it can be hard for him to[N]
fulfill a unique niche.[N]
Lastly, if you don't want to[N]
utilize Davis or Jacob's skills,[N]
you could bench them for[N]
stronger combat units.[N]
[N]
McVicar makes his first[N]
appearance in this chapter.[N]
To gain progress towards his[N]
recruitment, defeat Artus by[N]
Turn 8 enemy phase, as McVicar[N]
can very easily defeat Artus[N]
on the following NPC phase.[X]
