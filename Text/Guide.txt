## GuideHeader_AiToggle
AI Toggle[X]

## GuideEntry_AiToggle
Selecting this option will[N]
display an enemy/NPC's AI[N]
on the minimug box instead[N]
of their name.[N][N]
Pursue: This unit will move[N]
towards the closest ideal[N]
target if none are in range.[N][N]
Vigil: This unit will not move[N]
unless they can target[N]
someone within their range.[N][N]
Vigil mov x2: If moving would[N]
allow this unit to target someone[N]
on their next turn, they will move.[N][N]
Immobile: This unit will not move.[N][N]
Destroy: This unit can target[N]
destructible terrain.[N][N]

## GuideHeader_Plan
Plan[X]

## GuideEntry_Plan
Selecting this command will[N]
grant you the ability to[N]
move and act with any unit.[N]
This includes units that[N]
have already acted and[N]
units that belong to other[N]
factions.[N]
Units can be moved to tiles[N]
normally not accessible,[N]
whether that's due to terrain,[N]
being out of range, or both.[N]
Player phase won't automatically[N]
end after all units have moved,[N]
but you can still end the turn[N]
with the [f"]End[b"] command.[N][N]
While planning is on, no[N]
permanent progress can be[N]
made. This means that:[N]
- Suspend data will not update[N]
to match the state of the[N]
chapter during planning.[N]
- Fulfilling the win condition(s)[N]
will not end the chapter.[N]
- Fulfilling the lose condition(s)[N]
will not trigger a Game Over.[N][N]
While planning is on, two new[N]
commands are available in[N]
the map menu:[N]
- Future: This will advance the[N]
current turn number to the next[N]
turn where an event happens,[N]
such as reinforcements.[N]
- Act: This will reset the[N]
chapter to the state it was[N]
in before planning started.[X]

## GuideHeader_RecruitInfo
Recruitment Information[X]

## GuideEntry_RecruitInfo

recruited or is related to[N]
another unit's recruitment,[N]
the third page of the[N]
stat screen will reveal[N]
information about it.[X]

## GuideHeader_LButtonCycling

or NPC, you can go to the[N]
next unit in that faction[N]
by pressing [f"]L[b"].[X]

## GuideHeader_Skl
Skill (Skl)[X]

## GuideEntry_Skl
For every point of Skl:[N]
- If the wielded weapon has[N]
any Crit, it's increased by[N]
an additional 0.5.[N]
If a unit has 20+ Skl, they[N]
receive more benefits.[N]
- They can use weapons, tomes,[N]
and staves one rank higher than[N]
the user's rank.[N]
They still need at least an E[N]
rank to use E rank items.[N]
- The AS penalty from Wt is[N]
reduced by Skl-20.[X]

## GuideHeader_AS
Attack Speed (AS)[X]

## GuideEntry_AS
For every point of AS,[N]
Avoid is increased by 1.5.[N]
(Down from 2)[N]
The AS penalty from Wt can[N]
be further reduced by Skl-20.[X]

## GuideHeader_TomeRange
Tome Range[X]

## GuideEntry_TomeRange
There are some tomes that[N]
have 1-2 range, but most of[N]
them sacrifice that flexibility[N]
in exchange for another benefit.[N]
Keep an eye on what your magic[N]
units have equipped if they'll[N]
be exposed on enemy phase![X]

## GuideHeader_Fatigue
Fatigue/Fatigue Restoration[X]

## GuideEntry_Fatigue
Fatigue (Ftg) is a stat that[N]
increases by 1 every time[N]
a unit...[N]
- Enters combat, whether the[N]
attacker or the defender.[N]
- Uses a staff. The staff's[N]
rank doesn't affect this.[N]
- Steals, dances, or summons.[N]
There is no direct penalty for[N]
a unit having more/less Ftg.[N]
The cap for all units is 30.[N][N]
Fatigue Restoration (Frs) is a[N]
stat that controls how much Ftg[N]
is restored when the unit is[N]
not deployed for one chapter.[N]
This is the only way to lower Ftg.[N]
The stat is different for each[N]
character, but most have a[N]
value in the range of 5-10.[X]

## GuideHeader_RbtNoc
Noc/Rbt[X]

## GuideEntry_RbtNoc
The number of undeployed[N]
chapters (Noc) shown on[N]
Page 3 caps at 3 chapters.[N]
Once a unit is deployed, their[N]
Noc will be set to 0.[N]
When a unit gains experience,[N]
they'll gain additional EXP[N]
based on their Noc.[N]
- Noc 1 or 2 = 25% more[N]
- Noc 3 = 50% more[N][N]
The Rested Bonus Threshold[N]
(Rbt) is a stat equal to the[N]
unit's HP/3.[N]
If a unit has Fatigue less than[N]
or equal to their Rbt, they[N]
will get stat boosts equal to[N]
their Noc for the entire chapter.[N]
(Noc of 1 = +1; 2 = +2; 3 = +3)[N]
The stats boosted are Pow,[N]
Skl, Spd, Lck, Def, and Res.[X]

## GuideHeader_StaffStats
Staff Stats[X]

## GuideEntry_StaffStats
Staff Healing is now based[N]
on the user's Resistance[N]
instead of their Power.[N]
Staff Hit is always 100.[X]

## GuideHeader_LevelingUp
Level Up Gains[X]

## GuideEntry_LevelingUp
When finalizing a level up,[N]
the unit's stats will be[N]
compared to their expected[N]
averages at the same level.[N][N]
If a stat is at +2 and would[N]
increase, another RN is used[N]
for a final result.[N]
If a stat is at -2 and wouldn't[N]
increase, another RN is used[N]
for a final result.[N]
Stats (normally) cannot deviate[N]
beyond +/- 3.[N][N]
If a unit's net deviation from[N]
their averages is less than 1[N]
and their current level up[N]
increases less stats than[N]
expected (total growths/100),[N]
the lowest deviated stat is[N]
increased (random if tied).[N]
This process will repeat until[N]
the level up has gains equal[N]
to the expected amount.[X]

## GuideHeader_StatCaps
Stat Caps[X]

## GuideEntry_StatCaps
Units may have an additional[N]
modifier to their class's cap.[N]
These cap modifiers only exist[N]
for Pow, Skl, Spd, Def, and Res.[X]

## GuideHeader_GlancingBlows
Glancing Blows[X]

## GuideEntry_GlancingBlows
If a unit would miss an attack[N]
due to the 2 RNs, the attack is[N]
rerolled with 1 RN.[N]
If this attack now hits,[N]
it does half damage.[X]

## GuideHeader_WeaponTriangle
Weapon Triangle (3 mt, 15 hit)[X]

## GuideEntry_WeaponTriangle
The effect on Mt is now +/- 3[N]
(Up from +/- 1).[N]
The effect on Hit is still +/- 15.[N]
The Magic Triangle also[N]
uses these values.[X]

## GuideHeader_Terrain
Terrain[X]

## GuideEntry_Terrain
Certain terrain has been buffed.[N]
Res bonuses match Def bonuses.[X]

## GuideHeader_WEXP
WEXP[X]

## GuideEntry_WEXP
Followup/double attacks no[N]
longer give additional WEXP.[N]
Additionally, defeating an enemy[N]
doesn't double the WEXP gained.[X]

## GuideHeader_CriticalHits
Critical Hits[X]

## GuideEntry_CriticalHits
If the wielded weapon has any[N]
crit, Skl increases the unit's[N]
critical hit rate by an[N]
additional 0.5 per Skl point.[N][N]
The multiplier for a Critical[N]
Hit is now dependent on the[N]
net crit in battle.[N]
1% to 9% crit: 1.5x damage[N]
10% to 19% crit: 2.0x damage[N]
20% to 29% crit: 2.5x damage[N]
30% and above: 3.0x damage[N][N]
If a unit wielding a killer weapon[N]
is calculated to land an attack[N]
on their enemy, as long as they:[N]
   1. Have at least 4 more Skl[N]
       than their enemy[N]
   2. Have a net crit above 0[N]
... then the hit is guaranteed[N]
to be a Critical Hit.[X]

## GuideHeader_Effectiveness
Effectiveness[X]

## GuideEntry_Effectiveness
If not specified, Bows have a Mt[N]
multiplier of x3 when calculating[N]
damage dealt on a flying unit.[N][N]
Some weapons receive a Might[N]
penalty if the wielder's foe[N]
isn't weak to the weapon.[N]
The weapon's description will[N]
specify if it receieves one.[X]

## GuideHeader_WeaponRank
Weapon Rank Bonuses[X]

## GuideEntry_WeaponRank
Having an S rank in a weapon[N]
or magic type will augment the[N]
unit when they use that type.[N]
They receive +3 Atk, +15 Hit,[N]
+15 Staff Hit, and deal +5[N]
Staff Healing.[N]
These buffs are nullified if[N]
the user has WTD against[N]
their enemy.[X]

## GuideHeader_Bargains
Bargains[X]

## GuideEntry_Bargains
Above the preparations shop's[N]
usual merchandise is a[N]
limited stock of items that[N]
changes after each chapter.[N]
These items can only be bought[N]
once; the price of the item will[N]
display as 0 to show you've[N]
already purchased the item.[X]

## GuideHeader_Coupons
Coupons[X]

## GuideEntry_Coupons
These one-use items lower[N]
the next purchase of an item[N]
by 50% and don't stack with[N]
any other discount.[N]
If you don't want to use[N]
the coupon on a purchase,[N]
trade it away or make the[N]
purchase with another unit.[X]

## GuideHeader_SellWisely
[f"]Sell Wisely[b"][X]

## GuideEntry_SellWisely
While there are situations to get[N]
additional gold, there are no[N]
items that only exist to be sold.[N]
If you need additional gold,[N]
you'll have to pick something[N]
to sell. Choose wisely![X]

## GuideHeader_ReinforceWarn
RW Toggle[X]

## GuideEntry_ReinforceWarn
By default, this option is on.[N]
This toggle decides whether or[N]
not to display reinforcement[N]
warnings to you.[N]
One turn before reinforcements[N]
appear, the cursor will reveal[N]
where they will spawn.[N]
Shortly after that, there will[N]
be a hint on what kind of class[N]
to expect.[N]
If you want more information[N]
about an incoming wave, use[N]
the [f"]Plan[b"] command, then[N]
the [f"]Future[b"] command.[N][N]
During Preparations, this[N]
option is available after[N]
selecting [f"]Check Map[b"].[X]

## GuideHeader_TradeGiveTake
Trade/Give/Take[X]

## GuideEntry_TradeGiveTake
Trade, Give, and Take can[N]
be done more than once[N]
on a unit's turn.[N]
These actions will still[N]
[f"]lock[b"] the unit into their[N]
current position.[X]

## GuideHeader_Experience
Experience[X]

## GuideEntry_Experience
Combat experience is affected[N]
by unit level more.[N]

These items are as follows:[N]
  - Gems[N]
  - Promotion Items[N]
  - Elixir[N]
  - Perfectus[X]
  
## GuideHeader_Reorganize
Reorganize[X]

## GuideEntry_Reorganize
The Reorganize ([f"]Reorg[b"])[N]
command moves items up in[N]
a unit's inventory.[N]
This is useful if a promoted[N]
unit has multiple gems, as[N]
only the top most gem will[N]
provide its benefits.[N]
If a unit reorganizes, they[N]
can still return to their[N]
previous position as if they[N]
hadn't moved, just like[N]
equipping a weapon or tome.[X]

## GuideHeader_Stealing
Stealing[X]

## GuideEntry_Stealing

they get 50% more points.[N][N]
Units can reach A rank with[N]
all of their support partners,[N]
but only one support can be[N]
active for a unit.[N]
The active support can be[N]
changed during Preparations.[N]
When active, the units must be[N]
within 3 tiles to receive the[N]
benefits of their relationship.[N][N]
If a unit unlocks a paired ending,[N]
it can be set by pressing [f"]A[b"] on[N]
the relevant unit while they're[N]

The second McVicar entry[N]
goes over these specific[N]

After the third success,[N]
the last step is to talk[N]
to McVicar with Zoren.[N][N]
McVicar must survive in any[N]
chapter that he's present in,[N]
or else he won't show up[N]
in the future.[N]
Additionally, McVicar will be[N]
hired to kill specific bosses.[N]
Such bosses must be defeated[N]
before McVicar can do so.[N]
If a boss is defeated[N]
before he even appears on[N]
the map, it will count.[N]
Remember, you can view[N]
