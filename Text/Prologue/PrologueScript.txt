You're leaving?[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
Yeah, we're going back to [TR]Argustia[TR].[AN]
My dad said we're gonna live in the capital.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight]
The [TR]Argustian[TR] capital, huh.[AN]
How come?[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
He's a[TMM]...[TMM][.4]uh, I forgot the word.[AN]
He does the thinking for the army.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight]
A tactician?[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
Yeah, that's it.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight]
Wait, so he's not a [TR]Lor Movan[TR] tactician?[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
Nah, he's just here to teach.[AN]
But anyways, last night, he said[N]
he'll show me a thing or two.[AN]
That way, I won't get drafted[N]
onto the frontlines.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight]
Are you gonna come back?[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
You think I know that?[AN]
If a war's really gonna[N]
start, then I[TMM]--[TMM][A]

[OpenFarFarRight]
No, you bonehead![AN]
After the war.[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
[TR]Pyrus[TR], I might not[TMM]...[TMM][A]

[OpenFarFarRight]
You just said you won't be[N]
on the frontline, so[TMM]...[TMM][AN]
you'll make it.[AN]
I know you will.[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
[TMM]...[TMM]Who's the real[N]
bonehead around here?[AN]
Fine, I'll come back and see[N]
you when it's all over.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight]
You promise?[A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
I promise.[AN]
No matter how[N]
long it takes.[AN]
You better be[N]
here, though![A]

Maeva's just a few hours[N]
north of here, Zoren.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleSmile]Ah, this seems more familiar.[AN]
I'm glad I brought you along, Sir Iris.[AN]
Somehow, this route seems different[N]
from when I left Maeva.[AN]
I'm curious to see how much has[N]
changed since I left.[A]

I'm also grateful that you two[N]
came as well,[AN]
even though there was no need.[A]

[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
Aw, don't say that yet, sir.[AN]
It's a little too early to[N]
celebrate, don't you think?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Being able to take it easy[N]
has been nice, though.[AN]
Wouldn't you agree, Nordica?[A]

[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Ay, Orville.[AN]
I must admit, it feels[TMM]...[TMM][.4]unreal[N]
that the war's finally over.[A]

[OpenLeft]
I can hardly believe it, either.[AN]
Almost half of our lives have[N]
revolved around it,[AN]
and now that it's over,[N]
what's there to do?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
We can start with looking for[N]
Kamron and Luther.[AN]
They should be back by now.[AN]
Maybe I should go track them down.[A]

[OpenFarRight]
No need.[AN]
Up ahead, can you see them?[AN]
They should be on us any[N]
moment at that pace.[A]

Sir Zoren, Sir Iris![AN]
There are several bandits approaching[N]
from the north and the east.[AN]
At least a dozen of them.[AN]
What are your orders?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Even if these two villages have a militia,[AN]
I doubt it's something that can easily[N]
handle twelve men, if at all.[A]

[OpenLeft]
We'll have to beat the[N]
brigands to them.[AN]
Let's go![A]

I'm Laric, a simple monk.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
With a ten year war ending,[AN]
you'd think we'd finally have[N]
some peace and quiet, huh?[AN]
Especially since [TR]Lor Mova[TR] is so far[N]
from where the fighting took place.[AN]
I guess there's always gonna be someone[N]
that wants more of anything,[AN]
no matter what[TMM]...[TMM][A]

[OpenRight]
I wonder if [TR]Argustia[TR] and [TR]Tricinia[TR][N]
have trouble like this all the time.[AN]
I reckon those two nations were the[N]
ones hardest hit by the war, right?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, [TR]Argustia[TR] might[N]
not be so bad.[AN]
Prince Quinten's in[N]
his father's shadow,[AN]
but he'll get there some[N]
day, don't you think?[A]

[OpenRight]
Yeah, I guess that's true.[AN]
[TR]Tricinia[TR], on the other hand[TMM]...[TMM][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Aye, it's strange how[N]
things have changed.[AN]
One year, a formidable[N]
empire against the world.[AN]
And only five months ago,[AN]
they were fighting against[N]
not just invaders,[AN]
but against each other, too.[A]

[OpenRight]
I wonder how far the other nations[N]
got before [TR]Tricinia[TR] surrendered.[AN]
It must've been a mess if Empress Kirra[N]
couldn't keep everything together.[AN]
Her rule's certainly long gone, and[N]
chaos has taken over in her stead.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed.[AN]
These days, it must be a[N]
dangerous place to call home.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Sometimes, your attacks don't have[N]
the impact you're expecting.[AN]
One reason why is your aim.[AN]
You might suddenly realize you need[N]
to alter something,[AN]
or else you won't hit at all.[AN]
These [f"]glancing blows[b"] are only[N]
half as strong as clean hits,[AN]
yet they're better than missing entirely.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[.5][OpenMidLeft]
Another reason is the opening you exploit.[AN]
You must be very critical of your[N]
opponent to land devastating attacks.[AN]
If you only have a slim chance of doing so[TMM]--[TMM][AN]
less than three out of ten tries, let's say[TMM]--[TMM][AN]
then your attack won't be as powerful.[A]

Honestly?[AN]
If I look at the buildings,[AN]

But, if I look at the few faces[N]
that we've passed[TMM]...[TMM][A]

[OpenMidLeft]
[TMM]...[TMM][.4]Maeva's a fair distance away[N]
from not just the capital,[AN]
but any of [TR]Lor Mova's[TR] ports.[AN]
I suppose that's why the structure[N]
hasn't changed much.[AN]
